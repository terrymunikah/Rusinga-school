<h5>Early Years Foundation Stage</h5>

<p9>In our Early Years Classes, the Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum is followed. All areas of learning and development are important and interconnected.
    Three areas are particularly crucial for igniting childrenâ€™s curiosity and enthusiasm for learning, and for building their capacity to learn, form relationships and thrive.</p9><br>
